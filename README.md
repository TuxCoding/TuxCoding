## Hi there 👋, I'm TuxCoding - a Curious Computer :cat: or Raven in a Tux(edo)

Hello, I'm Alex. A (mostly) Java dev who loves to tinker and experiment with new technologies. Let it be for improving performance,
ecological effects or improving the state-of-the art software architecture.

Here I share some of my projects Open-Source for anybody to inspect, contribute or make their own version. I try to publish only unique projects
with documentations on how they work to help others moving forward. Give them a :star:, if you found one useful.

- 🔭 I’m currently working in my free time on: optimizing renewable with home automation and an OBS Streaming overlay
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: ⚙️ Rust and 🤖 Coding with AI
- 💬 Discuss with me about: new technologies for improving renewable energy use in homes (was my bachelor thesis)
- 📫 How to reach me: :space_invader: Discord#tuxcoding
- 📝 Pronouns: he/him ♂️
- 🗯 Fun fact: 🎖 Casual achievement hunter on [🚂](https://steamcommunity.com/id/games647) and 🐈 cuddler by Night
